# FantasyPros Perfect Draft Challenge 2022
This was a simulation model designed to find the optimal draft strategy for FantasyPros Bestball Perfect Draft Challenge in 2022. The goal was to use their mock draft simulator after the season with preseason ADPs and get the best performing team. Using this model I was able to place in the top 20 globally by the end of the competition.
