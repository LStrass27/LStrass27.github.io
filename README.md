# Introduction
Hi there my name is Luke Strassburg. I am a Rising Senior Honors student at the University of Minnesota studying Data Science. As a member of the University Honors Program (UHP) I have had the opportunity to take more rigorous undergraduate courses and will get the chance to present an Honors Thesis before my graduation in May 2025. The thesis will be a overview of research I have done on a particular topic. I am still deciding on a topic to present upon. In my free time I am an officer in the Sports Analytics Club and a member of the Statistics Club. As such, many of my individual projects in this directory are centered around the world of sports. My primary interests within data science all center around creative problem solving. Some of them are statistical modeling, optimization, and machine learning. Some areas of interest I would like to explore and get more exposure to in the near future include but are not limited to Geospatial Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Mining, and User Interface Design.

## Projects
More detail is in each of the corresponding folders for all the projects. I include the dates within the project names to show the progress I've made over time.\
**Predicting MLB Team Performance From Free Agent Patterns:** Used R to analyze free agent trends within the 2010s for the MLB and how it affected team results. Presented on at 2024 Ohio State Sports Analytics Conference.    
**Offensive Lineman Performance Degradation:** Used Python to analyze offensive lineman performance throughout a football game and whether there was a pattern to this performance based upon age. Submitted to 2022 Big Data Bowl.    
**FantasyPros Perfect Draft Challenge:** Attempted to create the perfect BestBall lineup for FantasyPros' Perfect Draft Challenge in 2023.    
**Interactive Fantasy Sports Draft Board:** Interactive python program that will keep an updated cheatsheet draftboard dashboard updating ratings based on which players have already been taken.
