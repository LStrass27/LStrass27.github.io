**Prompt:**
A unique feature of Major League Baseball is the incorporation of minor league teams into a multi-level farm system. Farm
systems are used in myriad ways, such as rehab, player development (both internally and for trades), strategy testing etc.
This year’s dataset will consist of multiple teams within a single farm system. We want you to consider a situation that compares players, teams, and/or game play at two or more levels. As with last year, we expect you to frame your analysis as a story. Show us how your work informs and contributes to others’ knowledge of and appreciation for the game.

**Our Project:** We built an interactive baserunning scouting dashboard for the catcher and pitcher level. The dashboard can be used to scout opposing pitchers or catchers by visualizing potentially important plays (such as pickoffs and stolen base attempts) and comparing their tendencies to those of others at the same farm level.

**What I was Responsible For:**
I built the entire dashboard interface in RShiny and designed the initial template for all the data formatting pipelines. Also consulted and delegated tasks to other group members and ensured we remained on track.

**File Organization:**
- Dashboard: Code for RShiny Baserunning Scouting Dashboard. Also contains tendency data and key play dataframes for the dashboard.
- Pull Data: Area where data pipelines and general data analysis files are stored.
